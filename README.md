# A Structured Latent Space For Human Body Motion Generation 


# Description

Modelling plausible 3D human body motion in a structured low dimensional representation can be benefitial for many 3D vision tasks such as motion transfer, completion or interpolation. We propose a low dimensional representation of motion which disentangles the influence of body shape and motion by leveraging a Variational Autoencoder framework.
